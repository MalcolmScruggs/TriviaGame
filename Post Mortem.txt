Summary:
Overall the project came togeth almost exactly as planned. I used https://opentdb.com/ as
a database to pull questions from. And I build a framework around querying it to get
the questions I wanted. My program currently supports all question offered by the API.
For the most part I stuck to my original plan. The first diagram is the one I proposed 
in the project brief, and the second diagram is how my final came out. (the lines just
show which classes use what). I put the diagrams at the bottom of the file because of
how big they are.

How to play:
-press run and click on button for the correct answer
-press r to reset the current question set
-press n to load a new question set

How to configure:
You can get a more specific set of questions by using the URLBuilder class.
The URLBuilder to change the actual set of questions can be found on line 17.
I have commented out examples of how to use it.

Incomplete:
The text displayer class was never really finished, I intented it to use create
a theme for creating text and then use it for the various diffrent text styles I
wanted. I never fully flushed it out because I didn't really need it, and I
wanted to focus far more on the trivia and networking aspects of my project.

Biggest trouble area:
The hardest part of this project was pulling data from the server and handling it
properly. It was primarily difficult simply due to how many little things to keep
track of there were. The times when it was the most challenging was when
a url was invalid and the server returned no actual results and formatting the text
that came with from the server. By far the most frusterating thing was getting
apache commons to import, but I finally got it to work. However it isn't a perfect
solution. There are still some really obscure characters that aren't caught by
StringEscapeUtils.unescapeHtml4. I never attemped to fix this because it would
have been really tedious, and would barely improve the quality of my project.

Best feature:
I think that best part of this project is also the part that gave me the
most trouble, pulling questions from a database. Because of this if feels like 
an actual trivia game with replay value. The customization that 
came along with using the server is also nice, because it can be fun to try out
all the diffrent categories and see how your talents compare. 

I think that my handling of quering the database is
an elegant part of my project. The way NetworkUtils and TriviaGame
interact allows my project to work offline and handle any other errors
that result from pulling from the database. It took me a while to
create the setup to do this, but I am happy with the result.
