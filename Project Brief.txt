TRIVIA PROJECT
-Malcolm Scruggs


Idea:
Create the trivia game by using an online database of trivia questions. The database 
that I plan to use is: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php

How this will meet the requirements:
- 10 or more questions: will dynamically pull from API which supports up to 50 questions per request
- Loaded from an external file: will be loaded from an external website. 
	(Could be saved to a file as backup)
- Visual / animation: will have a generic correct and incorrect response
- Inheritance and 2 subclasses: see proposed class structure
- Restart: options to (1) start with new question set (2) reset current question set

Plan: 
Trivia runner: manage score, current question, fetching and creating questions
Question: store each question is a question class that handles displaying and selection of answer
Button: class to creat buttons for answers and potentially reset buttons or other UI elements
URL builder: (low priority) class to customize queries to database and handle failed calls
